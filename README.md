# Extended-Kalman-Filter
I've developed an EKF to combine with my vex v5 programming algorithms in my other repos. It combines the v5 2 wheel 1 imu tracking with the vex GPS (qr code) sensor.
This code is meant to use sensor fusion between those two sensor systems on a 4 wheel differential drive robot to make tracking more accurate. This was never physically tested beyond proof of concept math and this initial code. In this form it likley won't be continued.
This code I believe uses the original algoirthms not the OOP versions and has not been updated to fix this. This code also requires eigen to be stored in the same directory in it's own folder outside src and other folders.
